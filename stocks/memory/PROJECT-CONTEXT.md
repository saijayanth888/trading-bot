## Circuit Breaker Logic
- Trigger threshold: portfolio < (peak_equity × 0.85)
- Current status: INACTIVE
- To reset: review trades, fix strategy issue, manually set status to INACTIVE here

## Notes
- Repository: shark-trading-agent (GitHub)
- All state is in this memory/ directory — committed after every routine run
- Hard rules enforced by both Python guardrails (shark/execution/guardrails.py) AND this CLAUDE.md
